Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. What did you do particularly well? Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network? What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
 For this project Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock you will need to apply program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

# What did you do particularly well?
1. For this project I thought I did particularly well with planning out my code and then executing that code. I jotted down in my notes how I could make it work before I tried to code anything. I also thought I did a good job of coding incrementally that way I would avoid finishing the project and coming across a ton of different bugs I would have to solve all at once.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
2. I think I could enhance my code by maybe replacing all the if statements with switch statements? The code seemed also to be longer than necessary.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
3. I thought the project as well as every other project in this course was challenging. I had to spend lots and lots of time on youtube, google, and reading and rereading zybooks to barely scrape by. I am still learning and I don't think in this industry I ever will stop learning.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
4. This project I think gave me a better understanding of functions and using different functions together. I know functions are definitely a core part of programming so I think that it will definitly transfer over to other courses and projects.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
5. To keep the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I tried to keep my code up to industry standards as best I could. That means following proper coding guidelines to keep it looking clean and trying to avoid redundant code etc.
